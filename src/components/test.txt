COMPONENTS FOLDER
==================

Purpose: Reusable React components

Use for:
- Button, Input, Form components
- Card, Modal, Dialog components
- Header, Footer, Navbar components
- Loading spinners, skeletons
- Toast notifications
- Any shared/reusable UI components
- Component-specific styling

Structure suggestion:
- Create subfolders for component types (Forms, Buttons, Modals, etc.)
- Each component should have its own folder with .jsx and .css files

Example files to create:
- Button/Button.jsx
- Input/Input.jsx
- Card/Card.jsx
- Modal/Modal.jsx
- Header/Header.jsx
- Footer/Footer.jsx
